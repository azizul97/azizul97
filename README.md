# 👋 Hi, I’m Azizul

🎯 I build sleek, responsive websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind**, and **JavaScript**, and I'm learning to power them with **Python (Flask)** and RESTful APIs.

🧠 I'm also passionate about integrating **AI tools** into my workflow to build smarter, more dynamic applications.
